# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hey!
My name is Jonah Watts, and I have travveled the world and worked on a variety of projects in the fields of programming, audio, and video. I am passionate about creating and learning new things, and I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and grow.

I have grown up in Canada, France, Burundi, and I have a passion for storytelling, sustainability, and technology. I have finished my degree in Computer Science at Trinity Western University, and I am currently working on a variety of projects. Check them out below!
